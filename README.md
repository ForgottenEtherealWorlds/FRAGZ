# FRAGZ
This document holds details about the technical details and mechanisms ("tokenomics") of Forgotten Ethereal World's FRAGZ (ERC20) token.

# Token generation
The FRAGZ (ERC20) token is generated by passive staking based on the continued ownership of two tokens (ERC721) in an account:
* Genesis
* Genesis Prime

For purposes of calculating amount of FRAGZ yielded - time of ERC721 token ownership is calculated from the time of mint until present.
FRAGZ are tied to the token itself, consequently any unminted FRAGZ will be transferred with the token upon transfer of ownerning of either ERC721 token.
